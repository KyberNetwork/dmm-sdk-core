# KyberSwap Core SDK
The KyberSwap Core SDK enables the safe handling of various data types (assets, math, etc.) when interacting with [Elastic](https://docs.kyberswap.com/liquidity-solutions/kyberswap-elastic/contracts/elastic-contract-addresses) and [Classic](https://docs.kyberswap.com/liquidity-solutions/kyberswap-classic/contracts/classic-contract-addresses) smart contracts in a TypeScript environment. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the [Elastic SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kyberswap/ks-sdk-elastic) and [Classic SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kyberswap/ks-sdk-classic).

```
npm i @kyberswap/ks-sdk-core
```
